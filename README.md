# Food Delivery UI

THe frontend for the food delivery app

I added an input field to the design with an autocomplete feature thar searches for the user and returns the delivery message on click.

## How to run

First rename the .env.example to .env and add the url to the api eg `http://localhost:3000/`

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

locally it should be running on [port 5173](http://localhost:5173/) or the closest available port.
For convience I also deployed on vercel at [sitename]()
